# Welcome to My Bash Scripting Learning exercise!

This is my **exercise** learning bash scripting. This repository could contain examples from another GitHub repositories as example of bash scripting. They will include their `README.md` files with all license and author and property info inside their folders.

Learn here about [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

```bash
if [[ 0 ]]; then
  echo "Hello World!"
fi
```
